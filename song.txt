Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had
Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had
Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had (It's Zesty, bitch)

Reminiscin' 'bout the time when you wasn't by my side
Everything was going fast, baby girl, you didn't last
Yeah, you had me in my bag
The times that you and me had
