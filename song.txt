Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had
Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had
Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had (It's Zesty, bitch)

Reminiscin' 'bout the time when you wasn't by my side
Everything was going fast, baby girl, you didn't last
Yeah, you had me in my bag
The times that you and me had

Don't tell me you gon' ride for me, I know that you lied to me
All my niggas doin' things 'cause we stuck in poverty
Don't tell me that you love me and you wanna fuck me
And you know me, nigga, I'm money-hungry
Niggas know what I do now, I'm stuck in the booth now
I am doin' things, I got a lot of shit to prove now
I was by myself and shit was lookin' greasy
Now you say you need me, but you never believed me
Niggas gon' hate, I tell them that we straight
I'm a young nigga and I came out the 8
Took my brothers outta state, and they doin' time
I wish I could go back and press rewind
I thought you said you loved me, why you say you hate me?
I was in your guts 'til you said you movin' shaky
Baby, please don't hate me, I just want your baby
You could be my lady, just stop movin' wavy

Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had
Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had (JayHollywood)

[JayHollywood:]
I thought you was just for me, findin' you not for me
I'm missin' you, baby, I'm missin' your company
When you sad, you come to me, I love you, you stressin' me
Fuckin' up my heart, keep fuckin' messin' with me
I don't even know now, rappin', singin' songs now
Wanted me after I made it, baby, you a dub now
I've been by my lonely, actin' like they know me
Think we goin' too fast, baby, take it slowly
I think 'cause I miss you, that song, think I dissed you
She suckin' my dick, said, huh, so she can kiss you
I'm fuckin' your love, ooh, ah, baby, do you love me?
I just wanted your hugs, ooh, ah, tried to play me
Baby, now you a dub, don't wanna see you no more
Baby, I'm askin' you, where did you go?
You better not let go, ride for me, don't hide from me
I'm bein' straight up, so you shouldn't have lied to me
Bein' with me, obviously, that you gon' really ride for me, woah
