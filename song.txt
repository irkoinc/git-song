Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had
Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had
Remember the times we had
The times that you and me had (It's Zesty, bitch)

Reminiscin' 'bout the time when you wasn't by my side
Everything was going fast, baby girl, you didn't last
Yeah, you had me in my bag
The times that you and me had

Don't tell me you gon' ride for me, I know that you lied to me
All my niggas doin' things 'cause we stuck in poverty
Don't tell me that you love me and you wanna fuck me
And you know me, nigga, I'm money-hungry
Niggas know what I do now, I'm stuck in the booth now
I am doin' things, I got a lot of shit to prove now
I was by myself and shit was lookin' greasy
Now you say you need me, but you never believed me
Niggas gon' hate, I tell them that we straight
I'm a young nigga and I came out the 8
Took my brothers outta state, and they doin' time
I wish I could go back and press rewind
I thought you said you loved me, why you say you hate me?
I was in your guts 'til you said you movin' shaky
Baby, please don't hate me, I just want your baby
You could be my lady, just stop movin' wavy
